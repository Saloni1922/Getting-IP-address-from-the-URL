##To get the IP address from a URL, you're essentially resolving the domain name in the URL (like www.google.com) to its corresponding IP address using DNS (Domain Name System). 

# IP Address Lookup Tool


Its a tool in which  Python script retrieves the IP address associated with a website URL. It performs a passive DNS lookup using the socket module's gethostbyname function.


# Important Considerations:

DNS records might not always be accurate or reflect the current IP address of a website.
This code doesn't perform any active scanning or probing of the network.
It's generally recommended to use this type of code for educational purposes or with proper authorization when dealing with websites.
